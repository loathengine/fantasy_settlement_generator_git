<h3 id="background">Background Flavor</h3><p>Everything in Raceway is about racing. Horse, chariot, foot, snake...it doesn't matter. Citizens run from one place to another as much as possible, and when they are too old or crippled to run they are carried by runners (and there is a specific competition of carrying old people around to the shops as quickly as possible). The village is surrounded by a cobblestone-paved track. Raceway is not far from Pit (#6) and they have a positive competitive rivalry between them.</p><div class="pageNumber"><p>1</p></div><p></p><p></p><div class="footnote">PAGE 1| Greymallow<p></p></div></div>
